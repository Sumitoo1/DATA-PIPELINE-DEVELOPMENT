Project Overview: Developing a Data Pipeline for ETL
Project Name
ETL Pipeline Automation for Data Processing
Objective
The goal of this project is to create an automated pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading (ETL). This pipeline will ensure efficient data preparation for analytics or machine learning workflows by leveraging tools such as Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-learn for transformations.

Key Activities
Data Preprocessing

Handling missing data: Replace, drop, or impute missing values.
Data cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle invalid data entries, and standardize formats.
Type conversions: Convert data types to ensure compatibility.
Data Transformation

Feature scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature engineering: Derive new features to improve data quality or relevance.
Data splitting: Split the dataset into training, testing, and validation subsets.
Data Loading

Save processed data to a file format such as CSV or Parquet.
Load data into a database or data warehouse (if required).
Enable reusability by exporting preprocessing pipelines for integration into machine learning workflows.
Script or Notebook Creation

Develop a Python script or Jupyter Notebook automating the ETL steps.
Include modular and reusable code using functions or classes.
Add comprehensive comments for clarity.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical computations and array handling.
Scikit-learn: For scaling, encoding, and feature engineering.
Joblib/Pickle: For saving and loading preprocessing pipelines.
Environment:

Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).
Optional Tools:

SQLAlchemy or PyODBC: For database integration.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For exploratory data analysis and visualization.
OpenPyXL: For handling Excel files if required.
